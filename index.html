<h1>My Profile</h1>

<p>Minwoo Tak</p>
<p>S3818058</p>
<p>I am from South Korea.</p>

<h3>What is interested in IT? When did I got interested in IT? Was there a particular event or person that sparked interest in IT?</h3>
<p>The major inspiration of my interest in IT came from my childhood. When I was young, My parrents bought me a smartphone as a reward for getting perfect score on English exam.</p>
<p>But the phone they bought for me was not what I wanted as I had certain adherence of buying the best one at that moment. Thus, I tried to look for what makes my new smartphone to be best at that time.</p>
<p>I searched via google what components does the smartphone have, what criterion makes the phone to be competitive in terms of its performance and how does all of those components function in the phone.</p>
<p>What I learned at childhood was not that big knowledge, but was enough to stimulate the curiosity of the child.</p>

<h3>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<p>The reason I came to RMIT is because I always dreamed of an area where I could learn from various environments. Thus I searched what universities can I consider to study abroad while I was a highschool student.</p>
<p>And then I found a blogpost on the internet by RMIT student. He posted what does he learn, how is studying abroad different.</p>
<p>RMIT in the blogpost came to me very a good decision not only considering family finance, but also considering the diversity of education they offer.</p>

<h3>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h3>
I expect to learn the direction where should I head. As IT is a various and wide field, I need to know what job or what field in IT is appropriate for me.

<h3>A description of the position and particulary what makes it appealing to me</h3>
<p>As we are depending on electric devices more and more, the cases of our intellectual properties being stolen grew up. But experts who are engaging in this problem are certainly lacking comparing to potential threats.</p>
<p>Thus, I think I can contribute sharing my works and efforts to ensure more secured.</p>

<h3>What skills, qualifications and experiences are required for this position</h3>
<p>Qualifications I may need are, few years of working experiences in similar field or career path as It shows I am not strange about dealing with the tools, programs and any programming languages.</p>
<p>And some certificate of qualifications which are obtained via exams related to Computer science.</p>

<h3>What skills, qualifications or experiences I currently have</h3>
<p>Currently, I have only met basic requirements like learning JAVA, objective C, and some experiences of dealing with them.</p>
<p>But I am going to achieve those qualifications by learning and building from my basic knowledges from diverse educators, trying to get certificate of qualifications.</p>

<h3>A plan of how will I obtain the skills, qualifications and experiences for the position.</h3>
<p>I am planning to study other major-related materials by myself. such as programming languages, network and security.</p>
<p>I will also be working on certificate of qualifications As it proves my skills are met enough to be used.</p>

<p>And also, I can reduce unconsciously occuring mistakes in working as a team.</p>

<h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team</h3>
As I am lacking of creativity, I will consider to get a teammate who has creativity as a strong point but has My strong point as weakness.

<h3>Project Idea</h3>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>My project is an AI-based power circuit breaker. The product can be planted in every place as long as there is home network.</p>
<p>It offers certain platform to connect the other electronic devices via home network. And It studies how frequent and around what time are the devices used.</p>
<p>Once it completes learning, it automatically blocks the devices to consume electricity as standby power when they are not in use according to the studied information.</p>
<p>It will bring less electricity fee for those who spends nearly half of a day out of the house.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>As we live in the era of technology, the use of electronic devices is growing rapidly.
Owning more than 3 electronic devices in the home is no more a rare scene now.</p>
<p>However, the more electronic devices we have, the more electricity fees we need to pay monthly.
Because, electronic devices consume electricity even when they are not in use. It is called standby power.</p>
<p>According to the graph below,
https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1.0028%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_726%2C$x_1%2C$y_1/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/861cf710c9400c012429bbb9860518e526073d44
https://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/standby-energy-consumption-adds-860-million-to-electricity-bills-20160519-gozbny.html</p>
<p>it is shown that standby consumption costs about 860 million dollars in Australia annually.
Average daily standby power consumption per house is displayed by 39.4 watts as well.</p>
<p>By planting the product, we can expect the electricity waste to be manageable.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The product must be installed in the home to be working properly. It is directly connected via home internet.</p>
<p>The product contains certain platform to link with other electronic devices. It can link with other products which are connected in same wi-fi network.</p>
<p>Once it links with electronic devices, such like a television or a computer, the product collects data of in what time the electronic devices were not in use.</p>
<p>The time when many of electronic devices remain out of use can be considered as the time the user sleeps, or the time the user goes out for work.</p>
<p>After collecting data, the product shuts down the power to the devices regarding to the time when the devices mostly were not used.</p>
<p>This may cause some troubles when user someday decide to use a device longer than before. But user can also manually turn on the device again or can reset the data.</p>
<p>There are mainly two ways for how does it shuts the power down of the electronic devices remotely.</p>
First one is installing an equipment in the house electricity system. In this way, it directly cuts the power to the electronic devices consuming standby power by the wall socket. Also, it can be materialized with current technologies with no big difficulties. However, it may cost more due to the additional installation of the equipment and the expense for the product may delay expected payback period.
Second one is to link the electronic devices via platform. To link via platform, electronic devices must support this platform. Once they link to the platform, the product can remotely cut the power by deactivating the power input. This can take control of the power input to each electronic device. It should have a few conditions met to be materialized. For example, electronic devices must support certain method such as platform to be linked with the product, solutions and precautions against hacking problem must be considered for commercial purpose. However, it is easier to develop and maintain than making an additional equipment.
For the AI part, AI don’t need to be so smart. AI for the product can be smart enough to study the pattern of the schedule the user makes. But it still requires a hard work to make an AI regardless of how smart it is, it will be difficult and cost a lot for this part.

Skills required
As for the hardware, it may require a processor to analyze the data, and a storage to store data, an equipment to access via network to link.
It may also require a hardware to cut the power. It can be a normal circuit breaker but operates with the product.
As for the software, it will require program to build a code to take action under certain condition.
AI must be designed to analyze the obtained data as well.
Platform must be developed and must have compatibility with the existing electronic devices to link and operate properly.
Outcome
As individual, the fee for the electricity use per households will be lowered as the product reduced electricity wasted. If it is commonly used among the households, it can also lower the price of electricity.
As government’s perspective, there will be no need to generate power as previously. Because, the total amount of electricity use is reduced. Also, the amount of resources used for generating the electricity, such as fossil fuel will be reduced. The government can use remaining budget to improve other things.
