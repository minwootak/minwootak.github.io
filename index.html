The major inspiration of my interest in IT came from my childhood. When I was young, My parrents bought me a smartphone as a reward for getting perfect score on English exam.
But the phone they bought for me was not what I wanted as I had certain adherence of buying the best one at that moment. Thus, I tried to look for what makes my new smartphone to be best at that time.
I searched via google what components does the smartphone have, what criterion makes the phone to be competitive in terms of its performance and how does all of those components function in the phone.
What I learned at childhood was not that big knowledge, but was enough to stimulate the curiosity of the child.

The reason I came to RMIT is because I always dreamed of an area where I could learn from various environments. Thus I searched what universities can I consider to study abroad while I was a highschool student.
